### Election-Audit Summary
This code can be used in a variety of elections with very little change. One proposal could be in school board elections with the only changes needed would be to the variable names to the candidates and the cities within the county. Another proposal would be for proposed amendment changes to the state's Constitution or votes on local laws. This would be simple as well. Instead of three possible choices there would only need to be two options, yes and no, for the proposed change and an expansion of the counties. I'll add a third as I think it would be the most interesting. By obtaining the voter data we could alter the code to look for demographics such as party. Another dictionary would need to be created for whatever we want to investigate (age, ethnicity, party affiliation, genderc etc.) but large amounts of the code could be copied. This way we could discover trends and all sort of information with the exit polling.
